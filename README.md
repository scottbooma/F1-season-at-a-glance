# F1 Season at a Glance

Click [here](https://scottbooma.github.io/F1-season-at-a-glance/) to visit the website.

This simple webapp was designed to give a reader a bried snapshot of where we are in the current Formula 1 season.

The first page is a features the race calendar for the season with past races "greyed" out. The upcoming race is featured at the top of the page with the weekend schedule listed out with local dates and times given for each event of the weekend.

The second page features the current standings for both drivers and constructors. It also has a drop down where a user can select an individual driver to learn more about how they are doing this year.

When a driver is selected an image of the driver, a brief summary about them, and their current results for the season. The results are in a tabular form showing their position and points value for each race. There is also a separate table for the Sprint race results that will populate after the first Sprint of the season (Emilia Romanga).
